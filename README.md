# My-Portfolio -
Portfolio containing past projects I have created throughout my coding career.

# Authors -
Kole Dallam

# Built With -
HTML - Skeleton of the website holding everything together.

CSS - Used for styling everything on my portfolio.

JavaScript - Used for the "contact me" section.

# Troubles I Ran Into
- Positioning boxes and trying my best to get everything lined up without creating overflow when transfering
to mobile view.

- The javaScript as simple as it might seem to some, for me it was looking a little rough.

- Some of the HTML "classes" and "href'" gave me a little bit of a hard time but I quickly found that they werent in the right order on the HTML.
